This repository is dedicated to a personal side project for the game Stationeers.
It serves as a collection of all the code I have created within the game, including scripts, automation setups, and other in-game programming efforts.
The goal is to document and share my work, making it easier to reference and improve over time.

Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, they are always welcome!

Note:
Please make sure to read the README.md file in each folder, as it may contain important steps and instructions to ensure the code functions correctly.
